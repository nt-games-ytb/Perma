# What is this ?
This is the code of Perma, a software that allows you to replace, download and modify Minecraft Wii U files.    
It uses the FTP protocol to make the connection between your Wii U and your computer.    
The interface is well done and simple to understand, everything is done to not complicate the task and you won't be able to make mistakes by deleting or creating a problem without doing so on purpose like with other software such as WinSCP or FileZila.    
I made a video to present this : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zD_UBy2ampw&t=9s.    

# How do I compile ? 
You can compile this with [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or with other development software in C#.

# Idea for the next update ?    
I never got around to doing them but here are the ideas I had planned for future updates :    
- Finish the minigames page (gamerules creator and minigames map)    
- Finish the music page (for extract and replace Minecraft musics)    
- Add a the maps page (for extract and replace Minecraft Wii U maps and edit .ext files)    
- Add a feature to know how many Minecraft you have on your Wii U and where they are    
- Fix problems with file uploads on my old server/host    
- Fix all bugs    
- Make a mobile/phone version
