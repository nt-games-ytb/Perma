# What is this ?
This is the code of **Perma**, a software that allows you to replace, download and modify **Minecraft Wii U files**.    
It uses the **FTP protocol** to make the connection between your Wii U and your computer.    
The interface is well done and simple to understand, everything is done to not complicate the task and you won't be able to make mistakes by deleting or creating a problem without doing so on purpose like with other software such as [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php) or [FileZila](https://filezilla-project.org).    
I made a video to present this : [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zD_UBy2ampw).    
I think the idea was good but the communication I did did not work and few people downloaded this software which took me a long time to create...    
I **apologize** for the **quality of the code**. It's not very readable and it's not optimized. **I was a beginner** at the time and I wasn't thinking about that part of the code.    

# How do I compile ? 
You can compile this with [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or with other development software in C#.

# Any ideas for future updates ?    
I never got around to doing them but here are the ideas I had planned for future updates :    
- Improve the code code, make it more optimized and easier to read
- Finish the minigames page (gamerules creator and minigames map)    
- Finish the music page (for extract and replace Minecraft musics)    
- Add a the maps page (for extract and replace Minecraft Wii U maps and edit .ext files)    
- Add a feature to know how many Minecraft you have on your Wii U and where they are    
- Fix problems with file uploads on my old server/host    
- Fix all bugs (with music player and other things)    
- Make a mobile/phone version
